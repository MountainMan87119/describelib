TL;DR | install/setup | commandline prompt while in "INAUG_LIB  ie.:  [        userMachine INAUG_LIB # ./setupInaug.sh              ]
*************************************

     The "INAUG_LIB" package needs to be under a location called 'home' or else the setup file, "setupInaug.sh" will need to
be edited by hand to reflect your filetree or your desire to locate the library differently.

     The library can be used to do work anywhere you want to cd to and it manages... but for installation purposes the
"setupInaug.sh" should be run from within "INAUG_LIB" the first time.

     When installing, a record is made so you can look under the hood.  During setup, some library files are shunted to
library subdirectories of "INAUG_LIB." and the library gets confirmation of what is extracted successfully and where things
are.  In the file made, "InstallationRecord.txt" found at ../../INAUG_LIB/InstallRecord_UninstallScript, you can see
instructions for Uninstall/Deletion.

     The crazy way is to *cd* to the Directory ABOVE "INAUG_LIB" and do :
     [[[       #   /../path/to/INAUG_LIB/InstallRecored_UnistallScript/ToEraseInaugLib.sh    ]]]
     
     Easy way is *cd* to Directory ABOVE "INAUG_LIB" and do :  [[[          # rm -rf INAUG_LIB              ]]].
     
     AND if you like to experiment, you can also *cd* to where you fine "ToEraseInaugLib.sh" and in that directory,
     do :
     [[[       #  ./ToEraseInaugLib.sh            ]]] and it works, but leaves the shell momentarily confused.

     Nothing is placed in the Registries, by this library.  The other thing it does not have is capability to create a desktop icon.
Those things may be added in the future, as well as a whole list of things the authour would like to include sometime.
