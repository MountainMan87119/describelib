TL;DR | install/setup | commandline
*************************************

Given a prompt as for example : MyLaptop-User-Tony home #

1.
MyLaptop-User-Tony home # mkdir INAUG_LIB
2.
MyLaptop-User-Tony home # chown -R apache:WebGroup /home/INAUG_LIB/
3.
MyLaptop-User-Tony home # chmod -R 774 /home/INAUG_LIB/
4.
MyLaptop-User-Tony home # mv /home/Downloads/describelib-master.zip /home/INAUG_LIB/
5.
MyLaptop-User-Tony home # cd INAUG_LIB
6.
MyLaptop-User-Tony INAUG_LIB # unzip describelib-master.zip
7.
MyLaptop-User-Tony INAUG_LIB # ./setupInaug.sh

It takes about a minute to install.

A Description of the Library
*************************************

    Inaugural Library is a small collection of BASH shell scripts, each of which creates
a list of a given format~type, of the contents of a Directory ~ and writes the list made
to file.

    There is a script which is run from the command line; an interactive subshell is
provided from which 48 small shell scripts can be invoked by entering a simple 4 or 5
character code.

    Some of the scripts provide screen output, others do not, but they all write the list
they make, to a file which can be used for input or work, saved for review or discarded,
as the user wishes.

    Basically, the library makes 12 different kinds of lists, with or without screen
output (12x2=24) and does that starting with *find* or *ls*; (24x2=48). The handy thing
is simply the ease of only entering 4 or 5 characters each of which represents some aspect
of the behaviour the user wants; after a little time getting familiar with the library,
it becomes easy to use.

More Notes on Installation, and Uninstallation
*************************************************

     The "INAUG_LIB" package needs to be under a location called 'home' or else the setup
file, "setupInaug.sh" will need to be edited by hand to reflect your filetree or your
desire to locate the library differently.

     The library can be used to do work anywhere you want to cd to and it manages... but
for installation purposes the "setupInaug.sh" should be run from within "INAUG_LIB" the
first time.

     When installing, a record is made so you can look under the hood.  During setup,
some library files are shunted to library subdirectories of "INAUG_LIB." and the library
gets confirmation of what is extracted successfully and where things are.  In the file
made, "InstallationRecord.txt" found at ../../INAUG_LIB/InstallRecord_UninstallScript,
you can see instructions for Uninstall/Deletion.

     The crazy way is to *cd* to the Directory ABOVE "INAUG_LIB" and do :
[[[ # /../path/to/INAUG_LIB/InstallRecored_UnistallScript/ToEraseInaugLib.sh    ]]]
     
     Easy way is *cd* to Directory ABOVE "INAUG_LIB" and do :
[[[ # rm -rf INAUG_LIB								]]].
     
AND if you like to experiment, you can also *cd* to where you fine "ToEraseInaugLib.sh"
and in that directory, do :
[[[       #  ./ToEraseInaugLib.sh						]]]

... and it works, but leaves the shell momentarily confused.  It sorts itself though :)

     Nothing is placed in the Registries, by this library.  The other thing it does not
have is capability to create a desktop icon.  Those things may be added in the future, as
well as a whole list of things the authour would like to include sometime.
