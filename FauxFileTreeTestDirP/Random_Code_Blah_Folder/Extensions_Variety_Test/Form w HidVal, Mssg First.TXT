I had this below snippet, then lost it.  I enjoyed it so much I wasted over 2wo hours, figuring it out again.

Well, not totally wasted, that time, learned a few things as I stumbled around.


<input type="hidden" id="HideItWell" onclick="hideSeek()" value=7 />
<form action="Those2.php" method="post";>
Read Message, Then Adventure Off!!!
<button type="submit" onclick="hideSeek()" value=$YY >Whoa!</button><?php echo "$YY"; ?>
</form>
